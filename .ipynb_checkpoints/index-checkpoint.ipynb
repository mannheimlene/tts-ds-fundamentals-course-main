    "SAS is probably the easiest to learn of all three. It has a good GUI that makes it even easier to learn and use. To effectively use SAS, one needs to know SQL beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "R has the steepest learning curve among these. It is a low-level language, so it requires more code for simpler tasks. Without prior knowledge of effective coding practices, the code can be even messier and longer to accomplish the simplest of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is known for its flexibility and simplicity. It doesn’t have a widespread GUI, but Python notebooks are popular. Python is a high level, object-oriented language, and is easier to learn than R.\n",
